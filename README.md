Automate Email attachment specific to a record
  Maximo can send email communication with attachments, in following ways.

By adding a default attachment(s) to a communication template and wherever this template is used, it will send the associated files as well. 
But this is set to a default document(s) and cannot be specific to record.
Other option is using 'Create Communication' option from an application, where user can manually add attachments and send.
This process of sending document specific to a record (like Workorder, PO etc.) 
OR a Person (like an approver in workflow) can be automated using script.
